Water Engine
================================

The engine is currently missing a renderer and a window management system. The University project this spawned from required us to use a framework provided by the teacher for rendering so I choose to remove it before uploading my code to GitHub. I may choose to implement one using SFML but I've decided to start a new engine project featuring C++14, a component system and other nice things, check it out!
